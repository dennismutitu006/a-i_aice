Discovery Activity: The Power of AI Video


We are in the last stretch! We have created the story, scripts, visuals and sounds, and itâ€™s time to put them all together and just like Aya, we get to tell a story with a lot of help from AI. In the guide below, we bring our videos, story and audio together to tell our story.

If editing videos is beyond your capacity this week, then go try a fun game to exercise your prompting skills. Say What You See is a Google Arts game where you get an image, and you need to create the prompt that made that image. It will help you understand how image prompting works.

Otherwise, head to CapCut and follow the guide below.

So, not perfect right? See why we need a team of animators to just make it that one step better?

One of the worst things for me is how strange it sounds to have American sounding voices there. These tools are created for the American market, so African voices and accents are not part of the standard voice packages. Would a business near you use those voices, or do they need a local version? See the opportunity there?
