Images are brilliant ways to tell stories and bring life to our work, but videos evoke emotions in people. Moving an image across the screen, makes us feel more connected to a space or characters in a video. However, AI tools still have a long way to go before they can create the perfect video. Still, considering how fast the AI space is developing, it won’t be long until we have AI tools that create videos that are indistinguishable from reality.

We’ll highlight two tools to animate images. LeiaPix (now known as Immersity.ai) is a free tool that allows good camera controls. Pika allows us to use text-to-video, image-to-video (with prompts), and even use a video to create more videos!

Our stories now have a visual part, all thanks to AI.
But before we part, reflect on this for a moment:

Reflect:
How will Generative AI tools affect visual artists and animators?
Donald Glover recently commented that AI allows us to make mistakes faster when creating art, and by rapidly prototyping, we can create a masterpiece faster. He goes on to say, “everybody’s gonna become a director, and everybody should be a director. ‘Cause at the heart of all of this is just storytelling. The closer we are to being able to tell each other our stories, the more we’ll understand each other.”

I like that idea, and it ties into what we think the future will be like – AI will enhance our lives and unleash our creativity.
